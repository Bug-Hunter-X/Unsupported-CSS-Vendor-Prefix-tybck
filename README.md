This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug involving the use of outdated vendor prefixes. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  The issue is that some browsers no longer support these prefixes, resulting in unexpected visual rendering. The solution removes these obsolete prefixes, ensuring wider compatibility and consistent rendering across all modern browsers.
